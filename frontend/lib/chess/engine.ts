 * Chess rules, delegated to chess.js.
 *
 * This used to be a hand-written move generator, and it was wrong in the ways
 * hand-written move generators usually are: no castling, no en passant, and —
 * worst of the three — no check filtering, so a piece could be moved out of a
 * pin and leave its own king captured. It also never detected checkmate,
 * stalemate, repetition or the fifty-move rule locally, and inferred castling
 * rights by looking at where pieces were standing, which cannot distinguish
 * "never moved" from "moved away and came back".
 *
 * chess.js is the library lichess-adjacent projects use for exactly this, and
 * the app's own representation is kept unchanged around it: `GameState.fen` is
 * the source of truth, and the board grid the UI renders is derived from it.
