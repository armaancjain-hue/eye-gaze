 * GET /api/health — is this deployment actually able to serve the auth routes?
 *
 * Signup and signin fail closed on three things the deploy has to get right: a
 * database URL, a reachable and migrated database, and a session secret long
 * enough to sign a token with. When one is missing they can only answer with a
 * generic error (anything more would leak configuration to the internet), so
 * this reports each one as a plain boolean — never a value, a connection string,
 * or a database message.
